## Mortal Online 2 Macros


I recommend **ATBSWP**, a minimalist macro recorder made in Python: https://github.com/RMPR/atbswp/releases/tag/0.3.0 (no need to install Python).

The macros are build using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#keyboard-keys).
