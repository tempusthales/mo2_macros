## Mortal Online 2 Macros


I recommend **ATBSWP**, a minimalist macro recorder made in Python: https://github.com/RMPR/atbswp/releases/tag/0.3.0.

The macros are build using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html#keyboard-keys).

[autoattack](https://github.com/tempusthales/mo2_macros/blob/main/autoattack) - Self attack with melee weapon

[autocast](https://github.com/tempusthales/mo2_macros/blob/main/autocast) - Self attack with magic (use spurt or outburst)

[autojump](https://github.com/tempusthales/mo2_macros/blob/main/autojump) - Jump in place (Ow, oh, hey, you, Who said that? Baby, how you been?)

[autowalk](https://github.com/tempusthales/mo2_macros/blob/main/autowalk) - For walking, aimlessly.


## Instructions

1. Once you install **ATBSWP** and launch it, then download the scripts in this repo to a folder.

3. Click on the Gear (6th icon from left to right) and choose Infinite Playback. I recommend you also choose Always on Top, so that you can float ATBSWP on top.
4. Click on the First Icon (Document with Arrow Up) and choose the script you want to run.
5. Once the script is loaded, Click on the Play Icon (4th icon from left to right).
6. The macro will run when you click inside the game screen.

Whenever you want to change the macro you are using, click on the Play button to stop it (step 5), then click on the Document button (step 4) and reload a new macro, then click the Play button to activate the macro, then click on your game again.
